    <h1>Welcome to Python!</h1>
    <p>Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python is used for web development(server-side), software development, mathematics, and system scripting. </p>
    
    <h2>What Can Python Do?</h2>
    <ul>
            <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications</li><br>
            <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows</li><br>
            <li>Python can connect database system, which can read to modify files</li><br>
            <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Python?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc)</li><br>
        <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li><br>
        <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li><br>
        <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li><br>
        <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li><br>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed </h2>
    <p>To check which version of python you have on Windows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open Terminal </li><br>
        <li>Type the following —> C:\Users\Your Name>python -–version</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>To check which version of python you have on Mac:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open Terminal </li><br>
        <li>Type the following —> python --version</li><br>
    </ul>
